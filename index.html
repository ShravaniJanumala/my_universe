        In Earth-94, I wake up every morning next to you.  
        In Earth-77, we run a quiet bookstore near a lake.  
        In Earth-13, we code silly projects and stay up all night laughing.  
        <br><br>
        But in this one, I just call you “Love.”  
        If I were a man, I’d marry you in every timeline.  
        <br><br>
        You are not just my favorite human—you are my whole universe.  
        <br><br>
        Happy birthday, Sai Sree.  
        I’m lucky this version of me still gets to love you.
